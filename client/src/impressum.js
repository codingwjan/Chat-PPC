                    The content of our website has been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the
                    accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our
                    own content on this website in accordance with general laws. However, we are not obliged to monitor
                    transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
                    activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
                    However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete violation of
                    the law. We will remove such contents immediately upon becoming aware of any such legal violations.

                    Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no
                    influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective
                    provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked
                    pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
                    detected at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not
                    reasonable without concrete indications of a violation of the law. We will remove such links immediately
                    upon becoming aware of any legal violations.
